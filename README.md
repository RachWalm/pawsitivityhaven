# Pawsitive Haven

## Introduction

Welcome to [Pawsitive Haven](https://pawsitive-haven-13024f62a5bc.herokuapp.com/).

![title]()


It can be accessed through [Pawsitive Haven](https://pawsitive-haven-13024f62a5bc.herokuapp.com/).

The Pawsitive Haven site is designed to fill a gap in dog rescue/adoption area. It is essential that once the dogs have gone into a rescue they are visible to the public to encourage adoption. Also there are many day to day administration activities that need to be kept in order to keep the dogs healthy etc. The aim of this site is to fill these roles.

As these dog rescue/adoption centres are often run by charities and volunteers using IT solutions to advertise and retain information on the dogs is often underutilised.

To step up the advertising campaign to get dogs adopted rather than just one picture and a list of characteristics with a paragraph about them, this site endeavours to show their personalities by getting the public involved in their timelines/posts/comments from walkers and the public. Hopefully, they will then get attached to a dog and adopt them.

The system will mean that the relevant information that the rescue requires day to day about the dog can be held in a profile and associated apps, of which some parts are made public and the dog will also get a timeline, where walkers/volunteers/people involved with the dog can post pictures and stories to make the dog more appealing.

Posts will be generated by the people who are walking and caring for the dogs on a daily basis, not by the general public, but comments can be made by anyone logged in.

An additional area was intended to show once they are adopted - the new owners can continue to post information about the dog and that way stay in contact with people who have looked after them in the rescue. Also this will give a feel good area for people thinking about adopting to see how it changes the lives of dogs. This has been placed on hold so as to stay within the timescale of the project, but could be added as a future development.


## UX design

To achieve this there needs to be first, a backend API ([github](https://github.com/RachWalm/dog-api) and [deployed]()) dealing with all the profiles, data and posts/comments. Secondly, a Front-End site (which is what this README is about) that deals with all the interactions required by 
1. The Rescue staff, 

2. Volunteers and Walkers, 

3. Potential adopters/members of the public and 

4. as a future developement the dogs final owners experience as posts.

Therefore the site needs to provide the different information that is appropriate to each of these roles. Keeping some information confidential to the charity and some visible to the public to advertise the dogs that can be adopted in a fun interactive way.


### Wireframes â€“ FrontEnd

The wireframes were generated during the idea stage of the process and are considered to be flexible to exact layout when the design of the individual components has been completed so that the end product can be asthetically pleasing as possible.

Two sets of wireframe were put together. One for each of the 

1. [desktop](/document/wireframes-desktop.pdf)

2. [mobile](/document/wireframes-mobile.pdf)


## Epics / User Stories / Tasks

The project board that has been used for this project is combined with the backend as they are interelated. The project board can be accessed [here](https://github.com/users/RachWalm/projects/4)

## Features

### Existing Features

The pages are designed by building up from components. Some components will be used on every page as they are relevant across the whole site and others are written as reusable components as they will be needed in different ways on different pages.

The pages will be :

1. Index/ dog profile thumbnails/search for a dog/favourites
2. posts for a dog
3. specific post and comments

4. how it works page

5. Queries form
6. dog profile set up
7. vaccinations


the components on the pages will be :

1. Nav bar
2. Dog profile
3. Posts
4. Comments
5. dog profile form
6. vaccnation form
7 query form

#### Forms on pages

All forms undergo csrf tokens to avoid any fraudulent behaviour. 


![deletemodal](document/deletemodal.png)

Deleting a charity does not delete any of the coordinators that are stated in the many to many relationship as this is not a ON_CASCADE relationship and the data of who is associated is stored against the charity. Therefore, on look up from the coordinators end for the see profile of coordinators it just won't be there any more.

#### Defensive programming


#### Flash messages

Most activities that involve change contain a flash message. If the user performs an allauth related activity (login/logout etc.) or if the user updates the database in some way a flash message should appear on the screen for 2.5 seconds. Other activities such as searches are apparent by the messages on the screen or results being displayed.

#### Search text function

This was adapted for the various searches throughout the site that are text inputs from a tutorial on youtube [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGtae4L5BbI).

```HTML
        <form method=POST action="{% url 'search_charity' %}">
            {% csrf_token %}
            <input type="search" placeholder="charity name" aria-label="Charity name search" name="search">
            <button class="btn btn-outline-info" type="submit">Search Charity</button>
        </form>
```
```python
search = request.POST['search']
```

## Deployment

### Heroku deployment

The deployed version can be accessed on Heroku [here](https://*.herokuapp.com/)

Before deployment you will need to collect all the requirements into requirements.txt

```python
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
and create a Procfile (with a capital P) containing:

```python
*
```

Ensure that the version that you want to deploy has been added, committed and pushed to GitHub (as Heroku will take it from the repository).

1. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) was used to deploy.
2. If you can't see the "new" button click on the Heroku logo in the top left

![Heroku logo](/document/logo.png)

3. From here we are able to create a new app 

![icon](/document/icon.png)

4. Next the app was named pawsitive-haven in lowercase and the Europe region chosen in these fields

![name](/document/create.png)

and the purple 'create app' button was pressed.

5. Now we used the menu navigation bar to select deploy

![tab](/document/deploy-tab.png)

6. The deployment method was selected by clicking on the GitHub icon and it stated that it was connected to github

![method](/document/method-github.png)

The repository was chosen by searching my github and then clicking connect

7. Then the branch was deployed 
![branch-deploy](/document/deploy-branch.png)

12. It was deployed

![deployed](document/deployed.png)


### Local Deployment

You will need to pip install the following apps:

react-bootstrap

```npm install react-bootstrap@1.6.3 bootstrap@4.6.0```




### Cloning

1. In the git hub repository, code button clicked
2. clicked local
3. choose HTTPS
4. link copied
5. went to terminal of the IDE and input the following :git clone https://github.com/RachWalm/pawsitivityhaven

The project was cloned.

It will be necessary to install the list in local deployment and also set up an env.py and reference it in the settings.

The env.py needs to contain:

```python
import os

os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="link gained from elephantSQL for the database see below"
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]="Enter your secret key here" 
```

A .gitignore file must be used and the env.py should be added to it so that the information in there that should be kept private such as the secret key is not put on GitHub.

To run the local deployment in the IDE terminal window :

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
